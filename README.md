## Introduction

The **LazyColumn DataGrid** project aims to demonstrate the power and flexibility of Jetpack Compose for building modern Android applications. By utilizing a LazyColumn, we can efficiently display large datasets without sacrificing performance. This repository serves as a practical example for developers looking to learn more about Jetpack Compose and how to implement grid-like structures.

## Features

- **Grid-like Layout**: Organize your data in a visually appealing grid format.
- **Column Separators**: Distinguish between columns for better readability.
- **Row Dividers**: Separate rows to enhance clarity.
- **Overflow-aware Text**: Handle text overflow gracefully, ensuring that all content is displayed properly.
- **Kotlin-based**: Built entirely with Kotlin, making it beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

## Installation

To get started with the LazyColumn DataGrid, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scufer/LazycolumnDataGrid.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Sync the Gradle files to download the necessary dependencies.

4. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Usage

To use the LazyColumn DataGrid in your own project, you can follow these guidelines:

1. **Import the necessary libraries**: Ensure you have Jetpack Compose set up in your project.

2. **Create a LazyColumn**: Use the LazyColumn composable to create a scrollable list.

   ```kotlin
   LazyColumn {
       items(dataList) { item ->
           // Define your item layout here
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Add separators and dividers**: Use the Divider composable to add visual breaks between items.

   ```kotlin
   LazyColumn {
       items(dataList) { item ->
           Text(text = item.name)
           Divider()
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Handle text overflow**: Use the `maxLines` and `overflow` parameters to manage long text.

   ```kotlin
   Text(
       text = item.description,
       maxLines = 1,
       overflow = TextOverflow.Ellipsis
   )
   ```

## Code Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **app/src/main/java/com/example/lazycolumndatagrid**: Contains the main application code.
- **app/src/main/res/layout**: Layout resources for the application.
- **app/src/main/res/values**: Resource files such as strings and themes.
- **app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**: Manifest file for the application.

Each component is modular, making it easy to understand and modify.
